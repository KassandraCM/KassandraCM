👋 Hi, I’m @KassandraCM
👀 I’m interested in web design, e-commerce development, and exploring new digital tools to bring creative ideas to life.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced JavaScript and exploring more about UX/UI design to enhance the user experience on the websites I create.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative web projects, especially those focused on creating unique and engaging online shopping experiences.
📫 How to reach me: You can reach me at kassandra.colmenaresm@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn.
⚡ Fun fact: I'm a problem-solver at heart! I love taking on challenges that require thinking outside the box, whether it's finding the perfect layout for a website or figuring out the best way to enhance an online store's functionality.
